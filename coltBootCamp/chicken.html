    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red
      junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl, originally from Southeastern
      Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may
      be called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult
      female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a term only for an
      immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant
      menus has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general,
      especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or domestic
      fowl were typically used for this.

      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries
      BCE).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
      (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
